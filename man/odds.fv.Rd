}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Odds of the format defined in input, the odds can be submitted as a data.frame or as a vector}

\item{Vectorized2wayOutput1stElement}{This speeds up the calculation as the output is a a vector that contains the FV of the first input. Usefull in dplyr chains.}
}
\value{
A vector or a matrix of the fair values of the the given vigged values in the format chosen in output
}
